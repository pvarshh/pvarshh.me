            <h2><a href="/">Advice for a Younger Me</a></h2>
            <p><a href="/">Home</a></p>

            <p>What follows is a list of advice I wish I had heard when I was younger, and things I think are generally useful. If it's useful to at least one person reading, then I'm happy. I will try to keep this list updated. In no particular order:</p>
            <ul>
		<li>What's worth doing is worth doing well</li>
		<li>Do thing's youre interested in</li>
		<ul>
		    <li>Let your interests guide your professional life</li>
		    <li>When you love what you're doing, it will show</li>
		    <li>Your passion will naturally drive you to be successful</li>
		</ul>
                <li>Don't overthink it</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trying to predict long-term outcomes is a futile endeavor; there's too much variance</li>
                    <li>Make locally optimal choices, and trust that it will work out</li>
                </ul>
                <li>It's better to be the best at one thing than mediocre in a lot of things</li>
                <li>Be principled and rigorous in your approach</li>
                <li>Strive to surround yourself with people you can learn from</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're the smartest person in a room, change rooms</li>
                    <li>You're still young, you're still a sponge; seek to learn from the best</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Ask for what you want, you'd be surprised how often you'll get it</li>
                <li>Moving fast is important</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A week is 2% of the year</li>
                    <li>You'll get more things done, you'll learn more</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The only limit is what you think you can't do</li>
                <li>Ask questions, a lot</li>
                <li>Seek to know people intimately</li>
                <li>Try new things often</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When our lives become monotonous, time moves quickly</li>
                    <li>Introduce novelty into your life as often as you can</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Document things more often</li>
